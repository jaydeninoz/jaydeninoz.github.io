# STATIC WEBSITE SHOWCASE

This is the repository where I keep all the files for static website development. 


Fortunately, GitHub allows its users to use this space to show their works; in the other words, others don't have to download it, instead they can directly have a look online. For my work, please visit:

1. Tindog https://jaydeninoz.github.io/tindog
instructed by Angela Yu

2. Dicee Game https://jaydeninoz.github.io/DiceeGame
